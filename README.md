# Cryptocurrency Project

By: Sarah Heavner, Tony Odom, Matt Tollman, Phil Quintanilla

## Brief Overview

In this project we wanted a better understanding of how cryptocurrency works and find out if it is a worthwhile investments.
To do this, we used data collected from API's and CSV files to create graphs so we could visualize how cryptocurriencies trend over time.
We looked at Yahoo Finance for long term trends, Lunar Crush for short term trends and social data, and Nomics for year to date information.
We decided to narrow down our information by the top 5 currencies for both volume and market cap;
This list came out to be as follows:

	* Binance Coin (BNB)
	* Bitcoin (BTC)
	* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
	* Ether (ETH)
	* Litecoin (LTC)
	* Tether (USDT)
	* XRP (XRP)

See presentation for our analysis of our data.
